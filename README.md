# University-course-search-tool
At the time of creation, you could not search courses for only certain periods. You could only search for courses that overlap the period you were searching. This annoyed me and made my life much harder when trying to plan my courses ahead of time. Thus, I created a better way to search courses in my university.

Unfortunately you can't actually run this code, only admire it. This is because I wont be releasing the original data files per rules and regulations at my University.
